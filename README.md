# nasa-deno
This is a Backend project, using Deno.

The idea is simple. Deno takes a NASA API from the SpaceX missions that took place in space
in order to discover some possible habitable planets (named "Kepler").

In this project managed by Deno, you can launch a mission in the future, see your history (Aborted launches and still running missions),
and see your upcoming mission, with the name of your choice.

The purpose of this project is to work with Deno, it's not suposed to be mobile responsive.
